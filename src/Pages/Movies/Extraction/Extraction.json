And, like WandaVision, it works extremely well. Marvel has been criticized for their movies and TV Shows all feeling the same, and She-Hulk does a great job of exploring a different genre (legal comedy) while still sticking to its super hero roots."

      "paregraph2": "The CGI ruins the show. The lead actress was GREAT in Orphan Black she can definitely play other personalities well but she just feels watered down thanks to the Disney/Marvel cringe comedy influence. Kinda like how they wasted Christian Bale in Love and Thunder. She should have been used in a MCU movie 5 years ago before they changed the formula. I really couldn’t make it passed the first episode. I literally got 27 minutes in before I just decided to tune out. I came here to write my review instead. Maybe if Disney pays me to finish it then I’ll get it a good review haha."
