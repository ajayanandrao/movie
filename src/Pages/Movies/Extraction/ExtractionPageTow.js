                A black-market mercenary who has nothing to lose is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. But in the murky underworld of weapons dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible.A one man army, armed and ready to go. A young boy abducted for massive ransom. Countless men with machine guns. A rescue mission which goes south. And a body count that goes north, every time you blink. Not stuff that you haven’t seen before, no. A lot of Extraction, a Netflix original, is an actioner which has been cobbled together from bits and bobs of similar movies. What keeps you watching is the rat-a-tat-tat pace when the going is hot and heavy, and also, paradoxically, when the characters slow down to catch their breath, and exchange a few words.

                Hemsworth, putting his trademark Thor hammer behind him, goes down and dirty in this one, which is located mostly in the seedier side of Dhaka, via Mumbai. His mercenary-for-hire Tyler Rake, hair mussed, eyes creased, weighed down by a tragic back story, is in search of redemption. And that comes in the shape of saving fourteen-year-old Ovi Mahajan (Jaiswal), son of an incarcerated drug lord (Tripathi), from vicious mob boss Asif (Painyuli).There’s some emo stuff thrown in. While on the run, Jake and Ovi (what kind of name is that?) find the time to share a few sentimental details about themselves: the former with how he is still hurting from the loss of loved ones, the latter about his dry, lonely life in a gilded palace. The gorgeous Golshifteh, who shows up bristling with fancy gadgets as the rescue mission manager, clearly has a soft spot for the wasted Jake, but darn, why don’t they get a tender moment to themselves? I wanted more of this actress who is capable of much more.
