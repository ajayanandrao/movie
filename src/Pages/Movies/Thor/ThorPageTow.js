                Thor Love and Thunder is a good movie with an absolute good storyline. The only downside is that they could have done it way and way better if they took more time (and make the movie and especially some parts at the start) longer. Also, not all jokes were funny and some jokes totally downgrade scenes that would otherwise be very cool. This movie was absolutely explosive fun packed into about 2 hours, never wasting a minute. It’s hard to get bored with the compelling characters (shoutout to Gorr) and the great humour and action that’s spread throughout.
