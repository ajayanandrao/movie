                If anything, “Valhalla’s” eight-episode first season improves on the original show – as it should, since it takes place in more interesting times. “To view Vikings: Valhalla as targeting the spirit of the times rather than to-the-letter of the times is to enjoy on its own terms, and its own terms are ultimately fair. Maybe they keep the show from being truly great, but in terms of pure entertainment and getting you to click that “next episode” button, everything here works perfectly.”
