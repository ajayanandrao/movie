                Download She Hulk S01 Hindi 720p HDRip: Jennifer Walters has a complicated life as a single, 30-something attorney who also happens to be a green 6-foot-7-inch superpowered hulk.She-Hulk is another superhero series at heart disguised under the veil of a certain cliche TV genre. And, like WandaVision, it works extremely well. Marvel has been criticized for their movies and TV Shows all feeling the same, and She-Hulk does a great job of exploring a different genre (legal comedy) while still sticking to its super hero roots.

                The CGI ruins the show. The lead actress was GREAT in Orphan Black she can definitely play other personalities well but she just feels watered down thanks to the Disney/Marvel cringe comedy influence. Kinda like how they wasted Christian Bale in Love and Thunder. She should have been used in a MCU movie 5 years ago before they changed the formula. I really couldn’t make it passed the first episode. I literally got 27 minutes in before I just decided to tune out. I came here to write my review instead. Maybe if Disney pays me to finish it then I’ll get it a good review haha.
